# spring actuator demo

- it helps to check application status.
- also i can access application metrics and meta data.
- once you add the dependency the "/health" endpoint comes automatically.
- to expose "/info" you have to define it , inside application properties file.
- there are other endpoints also available like ("/mapping") and more.
- use wildcard "&" to expose all endpoints
